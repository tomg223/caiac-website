      question: "What sort of experience is expected?",
      answer: "We welcome applications from students with a range of previous experiences: previous work in AI or technology policy is helpful, but by no means required. In the past, fellows have had backgrounds in public policy, law, political science, as well as a variety of technical fields. This is not an exhaustive list, and we encourage those with other academic backgrounds to apply as well."
    },
    {
      question: "Who can join the fellowship?",
      answer: "Past intro fellows have primarily been undergraduate, masters, and graduate students from Columbia. The fall and spring fellowships are strictly in person and on campus, so we can't accept non-Columbia affiliates due to campus security. The summer session is remote, so students from other universities and non-student professionals are welcome to apply."
    },
    {
      question: "When and where does the fellowship meet?",
      answer: "We ask for your availability in the application, and will attempt to accommodate everyone's schedules when forming cohorts. Each cohort meets once a week for two hours, with dinner or lunch provided. We'll be meeting in various meeting rooms across Columbia's campus depending on availability."
